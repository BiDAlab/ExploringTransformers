# Exploring Transformers for Behavioural Biometrics: A Case Study in Gait Recognition

![Header](./Images/AllTransformers.png)

# Overview

The present article intends to explore and propose novel behavioural biometric systems based on Transformers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the potential of Transformers for behavioural biometrics, in particular, gait biometric recognition on mobile devices. Several state-of-the-art Transformer architectures are considered in the evaluation framework (Vanilla, Informer, Autoformer, Block-Recurrent Transformer, and THAT), comparing them with traditional CNN and RNN architectures. In addition, new configurations of the Transformers are proposed to further improve the performance.


# Benchmark Evaluation on Gait Recognition

# Experimental Protocol

In this repository we include the experimental protocol included in Zou *et al.* proposed in [\[2\]](https://github.com/qinnzou/Gait-Recognition-Using-Smartphones). for the two popular public databases whuGAIT [\[3\]](https://github.com/qinnzou/Gait-Recognition-Using-Smartphones) and OU-ISIR [\[4\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132031300280X). A predefined division of the database into development and evaluation datasets is included in order to facilitate the comparison among approaches.
